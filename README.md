# <3Ɔ~ (The Rye Programming Language)
> "B-But... the name is a mouse emoticon...". Exactly, just follow these simple semantic steps: "Mouse" -> "Mice" -> "Maíz" (Spanish for corn) -> "Corn" -> "Rye". Congratulations, now you know how bored I can get.

They say that every competent programmer should write a lisp dialect at least once in a lifetime. I'm not saying they are right, but it definitely is an interesting experience. This is a ~2h project that ended up in a language that allowed to make a naïve primality test which, for me, is a basic seal of aproval.

This language does not allow recursion because function calls are not hygienic (i.e. it does not have scopes), but it definitelly allows some simple procedures and function definitions as long as you are careful with names. There is no documentation because, let's be honest here, nobody is going to use this language. You can see as far as I went with it on the `main.py` file.

I really recomend you try to implement something similar yourself :)
